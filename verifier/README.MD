# Verifier Contract

## Overview
The Verifier contract is an abstract smart contract that allows for efficient and secure verification of Merkle proofs and addresses. It provides functionality to verify if a provided proof matches a stored root and to verify the validity of an address using a Merkle proof.

This contract is designed to be extensible and can be inherited and used by other contracts to provide Merkle tree-based proof verification.
## Features
- Merkle Proof Verification: The contract can verify a proof against a known root.
- Address Verification: The contract can verify if a given address is valid according to a provided Merkle proof.
- Ownership Management: The owner of the contract can update the root and transfer ownership of the contract.
- Efficient Hashing: Uses efficient hashing for Merkle proof processing.

## Contract Methods

1. verify(bytes32[] memory proof, bytes32 leaf) internal view returns (bool)

Verifies if the provided proof for a leaf matches the stored root.

- proof: An array of bytes32 values representing the Merkle proof.
- leaf: The leaf node to verify.

Returns true if the proof is valid, otherwise false.

2. verifyaddress(bytes32[] memory proof, address addr) internal view returns (bool)

Verifies if the provided address is valid according to the Merkle proof.

- proof: An array of bytes32 values representing the Merkle proof.
- addr: The address to verify.

Returns true if the address is valid, otherwise false.

3. processProof(bytes32[] memory proof, bytes32 leaf) internal pure returns (bytes32)

Processes the proof to compute the hash from the leaf and proof data.

- proof: An array of bytes32 values representing the Merkle proof.
- leaf: The leaf node to verify.

Returns the computed hash after processing the proof.

4. setRoot(bytes32 root) public virtual

Sets a new root value. Only the contract owner can call this function.

- root: The new root value to set.

5. transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual

Transfers ownership of the contract to a new address. Only the current owner can call this function.

- newOwner: The address to transfer ownership to.

6. owner() public view virtual returns (address)

Returns the current ownerâ€™s address.

7. getRoot() public view virtual returns (bytes32)

Returns the current root value stored in the contract.

## Usage

### Installation
```sh
npm install verifier-contract
```

### Deploying the Contract

1. Deploy the contract with an initial root value.
```solidity
bytes32 initialRoot = 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef;
Verifier verifier = new Verifier(initialRoot);
```

### Verifying a Proof

1. You can verify a proof for a leaf node by calling the verify function.
```solidity
bytes32 leaf = 0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890;
bytes32[] memory proof = [0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890];
bool isValid = verifier.verify(proof, leaf);
```
    
2. To verify an address, you can call the verifyaddress function.
```solidity
address addr = 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678;
bytes32[] memory proof = [0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890];
bool isValidAddress = verifier.verifyaddress(proof, addr);
```

3. Updating the Root

Only the owner can update the root. To set a new root, the owner can call:
```solidity
verifier.setRoot(newRoot);
```

4. Transferring Ownership

To transfer ownership to another address, the current owner can call:
```solidity
verifier.transferOwnership(newOwnerAddress);
```

## Example

Here is a full example of how you might deploy and interact with the contract in a JavaScript file using Hardhat:
```js
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Set the root
    const initialRoot = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes("initialRoot"));

    // Deploy the contract
    const Verifier = await ethers.getContractFactory("Verifier");
    const verifier = await Verifier.deploy(initialRoot);
    console.log("Verifier deployed to:", verifier.address);

    // Verify a proof (replace with actual proof data)
    const proof = [ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32))];
    const leaf = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes("leaf"));
    const isValidProof = await verifier.verify(proof, leaf);
    console.log("Is the proof valid?", isValidProof);

    // Transfer ownership
    await verifier.transferOwnership(owner.address);
    console.log("Ownership transferred to:", owner.address);
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```
